        How Does This Connect to <i>PHIL11</i>?
      </h2>
      <p>
        David Chalmers' research into conciouscness stems from phenomenology.
        This philosphical school of thought focuses on first person point of
        view or how things are percieved. In PHIL11, we studied a few of the
        pioneers of this way of thinking. For example, David Hume focused on
        explaing the unreliability of beliefs, and how they come from
        impressions. Additionally, Rene Descartes used analogy of wax melting to
        explain how our perceptions and experiences are faulty at describing a
        given phenomenon. Although these thought conclusions may seem unrelated
        to Chalmers, they were crucial in setting the foundation for his way of
        thinking, creating the distinction between what is percieved and what is
        actually there.

        However, one of the most apt readings in the course that connects to
        Chalmers' exploration into counciousness is Jay Garfield's{" "}
        <i>Engaging Buddishm</i>. In this text, Garfield explores Buddhism's
        interpretation of self, and what it means to be councious. He touches on
        philosophers Kumārila and Gangeśa that argue that identiy and the
        concept of 'self' rely critically on the existince of conciousness.
        However, the counciousness they refer is not a mere mechanical process,
        it exists outside and free from the body. This closely relates to
        Chalmer's perspective of councisness not being a construction of other
        fundamental properties, but rather being a fundamental element itself.
